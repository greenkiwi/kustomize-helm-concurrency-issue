# kustomize-helm-concurrency-issue

Demonstrate issue with concurrency when doing multiple kustomize build operations at the same time with --helm-enabled

See: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/5271

We run `kustomize build` on all of our various overlays in our CI process. This allows us to test whether or not we have
broken any of our overlays. We have a lot of overlays, and we have a lot of CI jobs that run in parallel. We have
recently started using the `--helm-enabled` flag to allow us to use helm charts in our overlays. We have noticed that
when we run multiple `kustomize build` operations at the same time, we get errors like this:

```

```

This repo provides an example of this error.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repo
2. Run (sometimes multiple times)
```shell
# Remove the existing charts file as it is not present in CI
rm -rf base/charts
# Run the build script
./kustomize-build
```
